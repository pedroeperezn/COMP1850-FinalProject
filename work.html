                <h2>Game Development</h2>
                <h3>Everything Must Go!</h3>
                <p>Everything Must Go! is a 3D Top-Down Competitive Multiplayer Battle Racing game in which 4 contestants compete in "Everything Must Go!", a shopping game show where they must race shopping carts around the "Everything Must Go!" store set to collect and checkout the highest total value of products. Players will drive powered shopping carts, collect stacks of products and use powerups while crashing, bumping and stealing from other players to get ahead of each other. The player who wins takes home their loot, and the losers must pay the price!
                </p>
                <p>In "Everything Must Go!", I programmed network multiplayer mechanics and programmed/implemented audio functionality. This meant using replication and remote procedural calls in most mechanics to ensure that the most relevant information was correctly shared between the server and clients. The mechanics with which I collaborated for the project were mainly related to item interaction and spawning, player's inventory and score, implementation of power-ups, audio, minor UI programming and debugging tools implementation using ImGUI.</p>

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p> I started my musical career when I was around 10 years old. After playing Guitar Hero 3, I became obsessed with playing the guitar. Short after completing the game, I decided that I wanted to learn the real thing, which is why I begged my parents for an electric guitar.</p>
                <p>After learning and playing with several friends, bands and projects in my youth, I decided to take a more serious approach towards music when I was going through my bachelors' in Audio Engineering. There, I learned how to properly record and produce music, while I trained myself in composing and arranging. Shortly after graduating, I decided to make a business out of my skill set and started a freelance career as a session musician and music producer, as well as self-produced several personal projects.</p>
                <h3>Music Production</h3>
                <p>In 2021, I started a freelance music production career mainly through online freelancing platforms. I've had the opportunity to work with several artists throughout the world through services such as instrumental track production, mixing/mastering, and guitar/bass track recording.</p>

                <h3>Peter Narez</h3>
                <p>Peter Narez is my solo project. It started as my graduation project, in which (given the limitations that the COVID-19 pandemic brought) I had to solo-produce a complete EP while locked-down at home. After this, I focused on producing my single "Los Besos Que Me Debes", which translates to "The Kisses You Owe Me". This song's lyrics were inspired in the longing for reuniting with loved ones we were not able to see for months because of the lock-down.</p>

                <h2>Lazuli VI</h2>
                <p>Lazuli VI was a project I co-produced amongst two college colleagues. After graduating, we wanted to produce music to potentially build a name of ourselves and provide production services and eventually a record label. Although those dreams faded away because of our own personal interests and path, we still published music that we are proud of that is still available in streaming platforms.</p>

                <h2>Los Orfans</h3>
                <p>"Los Orfans" was the musical project I worked on during college. "Los Orfans" was a hard rock band in which I collaborated mainly as guitarist and producer. Upon graduating college, we recorded all our tracks and published our only EP "Musa de Fuego".</p>
