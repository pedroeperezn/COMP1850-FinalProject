                Hello! My name is Pedro. I'm an audio engineer currently enrolled in the Computer Systems Certificate at BCIT. My professional goal currently is to expand my knowledge on creative technology development through programming. 
            </p>
            <h2> Early Career </h2>
            <p>
                I studied a bachelor's degree in Audio Engineering in Mexico City at the Teconologico de Monterrey, State of Mexico Campus. After graduating with honors, I started working as a freelance audio engineer/music producer. Short after kick starting my freelance career, I started working at Bunkerganesh, a recording studio focused on multimedia production, audiobooks, and dubbing.  
            </p>
            <h2> Programming & Arriving to Vancouver </h2>
            <p>
                After 2 years of focusing mainly on audio and music production, I realized I really missed the more technical/engineering part of my studies. This is why I decided to build upon the programming foundations I learned in college to get into software development. After finding myself fascinated about programming and computer systems, I decided that I wanted to formalize my education in programming while still focusing on the entertainment industry, which is why I enrolled in the "Programming for Games, Web & Mobile" program at the Vancouver Film School. At VFS, I learned strong programming fundamentals in languages such as C++, C#, and Python. I also learned the basics of Web Development and Mobile Development. 
            </p>
            <h2> Now </h2>
            <p>
                After graduating VFS, I decided to continue my studies in programming and potentially pursue a degree. This is why I enrolled in the Flexible Learning program of Computer Systems. I would like to hold a second bachelors' degree on computer systems so that I can aspire to a wider range of opportunities both in the entertainment industry and in the technological industry.
